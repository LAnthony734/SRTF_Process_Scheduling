This project was an exercise in C structs and queues. The functionality for manipulating headers (see header_t in structs.h) and enqueing and dequeuing processes (see process_t in structs.h) by Shortest Run Time First (SRTF) is provided in srtf.c. No code is provided for testing this functionality; however, example trace files and clock management files are provided for anyone interested in creating such code. More project details are available upon request.
